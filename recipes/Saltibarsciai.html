        Saltibarsciai is a traditional Lithuanian cold beet soup. It is a beloved dish in Lithuania and is often enjoyed during the summer months. The soup is made with a base of buttermilk and beetroot, giving it a vibrant pink color. Along with the beets, it is also flavored with cucumbers, dill, and hard-boiled eggs, adding a refreshing and savory taste to the soup. The combination of the cool temperature and the tangy flavors make Saltibarsciai a perfect dish to beat the summer heat. It is commonly served chilled and garnished with additional fresh dill and a dollop of sour cream. Whether you're looking for a light and refreshing appetizer or a satisfying main course, Saltibarsciai is a delightful choice that showcases the flavors of Lithuania's culinary heritage.
